## Description

![ResumosLEIC](/experience/resumos-leic/leic.png#center)

Worked alongside [Diogo Correia](https://diogotc.com), as well as a huge [group of contributors](https://github.com/leic-pt/resumos-leic/graphs/contributors)
on the creation and maintenance of [ResumosLEIC](https://leic.pt), a website which
compiles tools and course notes from the Computer Science and Engineering
Bachelor's degree at my university.

## Contributions

I worked as the main contributor for the class notes
of courses such as [Algorithms' Synthesis and Analysis](https://leic.pt/asa)
and [Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures](https://leic.pt/iaed),
among a plethora of others, as well as updating the content of courses across years,
to ensure that the information was always up-to-date with the latest syllabus.

Furthermore, was, alongside Diogo Correia, responsible for the maintenance and acceptance
of new class notes, being a reviewer of hundreds of pull requests from contributors,
both new and old, to ensure that the quality of the content was always as best as possible.
