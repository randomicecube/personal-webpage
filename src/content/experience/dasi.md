### Description

- Worked, from the first stages of development onwards, on the creation of the
  second version of the **Técnico API**, IST's [institutional API](https://github.com/ist-dsi/fenixedu-api).
  Had my first production-level contact with Java (and Spring), while also having
  worked on thoroughly documenting it with [OpenAPI 3.1.0](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/18/openapi-specification-3-1-released).

- Worked on Técnico's Mobile App (available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.ist.mobile&hl=pt_PT&gl=US)
  and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/t%C3%A9cnico-lisboa/id959976468)), written
  in React Native.
