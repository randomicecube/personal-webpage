### Description

I recently submitted a research paper to the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE) journal, which explores the integration of N-version programming with automatic programming language translation, utilizing large language models (LLMs). Additionally, I undertook a complete refactoring of a tool, developed in both Python and C++, designed to aid in the development and testing of LLM-driven automatic code translation, for the aforementioned paper. Currently, my focus is on developing an automated feedback system aimed at addressing software supply chain errors commonly made by students, using tools such as SonarScanner alongside LLMs -- if everything goes well, this will probably end up being what my Master's thesis is about!
