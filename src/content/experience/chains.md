### Description

We recently submitted a research paper to the IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC) journal,
which explores the integration of N-version programming with automatic programming language translation,
utilizing large language models (LLMs).
Additionally, I undertook a complete refactoring of a tool, developed in both Python and C++, designed
to aid in the development and testing of LLM-driven automatic code translation, for the aforementioned paper.

Currently, my focus is on developing an automated feedback system aimed at addressing software supply chain errors
commonly made by students, using [dirty-waters](https://github.com/chains-project/dirty-waters) as its driver.
Toward this, I have had to focus on this both from a research assistant and as a Master's thesis student
perspective:

- From the former, I have been responsible for implementing Maven support for dirty-waters, as well
  as bug fixing, refactoring, documenting, and implementing caching features -- the latter of which
  has been particularly challenging but rewarding, with the system now being able to run
  in around 5-10s, down from 10-15 minutes for the [Spoon](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon) project, as an example.
- From the latter, I have been responsible for the creation of a CI action for dirty-waters,
  in order to be able to use the tool in an easier manner, both in student and developer environments.
  I will then proceed to evaluate the tool in real-world scenarios, by being employed
  both in open-source projects as well as in courses at KTH.
