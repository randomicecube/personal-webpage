My major contribution was the development, alongside a team of several members, ranging from senior colleagues to other student developers, of a new version of the university\u0026rsquo;s public API, featuring dozens of endpoints written in Java (Spring) and thoroughly documented using YAML (OpenAPI). To enhance accessibility, we created a user-centered display of the public API by setting up a custom website with NodeJS. We also optimized the deployment process by implementing a custom GitLab CI/CD pipeline with four stages, which significantly reduced deployment time and improved image-building reliability through automated version releases. Additionally, we improved the responsiveness and reliability of the university’s React Native mobile app by identifying and fixing bugs, alongside testing.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/experience/dasi/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"description\"\u003eDescription\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayed a role in developing, testing, and maintaining several components of my university’s learning management system, FenixEdu, which is built using Java and the Spring framework.
